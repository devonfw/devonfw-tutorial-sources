= Project Setup
In this step we are going to create our work environment and establish the first part of our backend. Like most *devonfw* projects, our backend will be build in Java and thus utilize the tools, liraries and frameworks provided by the https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[devon4j] stack.

== Setting up a devonfw Work Environment
Follow the setup instructions listed https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/blob/master/documentation/setup.asciidoc[here]. +
After you have done so, your working directroy should look like this:

image::images/setup/after_setup.png[After Setup, 250]

Press "Shift + Right Click" and select "Open Devon CMD shell here". +
Your shell should now show the message:

____
devon-ide environment variables have been set for C:\\... in workspace main
____

Navigate into workspace "main" by entering:

----
C:\...> cd workspaces\main
----

== Creating the Project
Now we are going to create the folder structure for our backend by running the following commands:

----
C:\...\workspaces\main>                 mkdir jumpthequeue
C:\...\workspaces\main>                 cd jumpthequeue
C:\...\workspaces\main\jumpthequeue>    mkdir java
C:\...\workspaces\main\jumpthequeue>    cd java
C:\...\workspaces\main\jumpthequeue\java>
----

Here we are going to generate our devon4j application template as a starting point for our backend:

----
C:\...\workspaces\main\jumpthequeue\java>
    devon java create com.devonfw.application.jtqj com.devonfw.java.jtqj -Dversion=0.0.1
----

[NOTE]
====
We are using the `java` https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/blob/master/documentation/java.asciidoc[commandlet] of the devon-ide. After the command `create` we are passing the arguments `package`, `groupId` and `version` in this case.
====

Once you see the `BUILD SUCCESS` message, the new app template has been created and can now be expanded.

== Importing the Application in Eclipse
First we have to launch our project-specific Eclipse instance by executing the `eclipse-main.bat` script in the root folder. Now we can import our application into Eclipse:

image::images/setup/eclipse_import_1.png[Eclipse Maven Import 1, 350]

Select `Import projects...` from the Package Explorer (or optionally `Import...` via the `File` menu).

image::images/setup/eclipse_import_2.png[Eclipse Maven Import 2, 450]

Select `Existing Maven Projects` and click `Next >`. +
Now click `Browse` and select the `java` folder inside our `jumpthequeue` project.

image:images/setup/eclipse_import_3.png[Eclipse Maven Import 3, 550]
image:images/setup/eclipse_import_4.png[Eclipse Maven Import 4, 550]

Eclipse will detect the pre-generated Maven project structure inside our project by looking for `pom.xml` files. +
In our case it should find the `api`, `core` and `server` packages. +
Finally click `Finish` and wait for the import to complete.

== Preparing the Backend for an Initial Launch
Before test-launching our backend we have to change the the _server context path_ of our application. Via the Eclipse Package Explorer navigate to:

----
/jtqj-core/src/main/resources/config/
----

Now open `application.properties` and update the following line of code:

----
server.servlet.context-path=/jumpthequeue
----

[TIP]
====
For a more manageable view of the package structure inside the Eclipse Package Explorer select `Package Presentation > Hierarchical` from the small image:images/setup/small_dropdown.png[Dropdown Icon, 20] dropdown-menu.

image::images/setup/hierarchical_view.png[Hierarchical View, 550]
====

== Launching the Backend
Finally, using _Spring Boot_ (which provides us with an embedded _Tomcat_ server), we can run the backend of our app in one easy step. Navigate to:

----
/jtqj-core/src/main/java/com.devonfw.application.jtqj/
----

Now right click `SpringBootApp.java` select `Run As > Java Application`.

image::images/setup/run_java_app.png[Run as Java Application, 650]

If you did everything right up until now the console should show a message like this:

----

 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \

... o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8081 (http) with context path '/jumpthequeue'
... c.d.application.jtqj.SpringBootApp       : Started SpringBootApp in XX.XXX seconds (JVM running for XX.XXX)
----

The backend is now accessible via http://localhost:8081/jumpthequeue[localhost:8081/jumpthequeue]. +
You can view the exposed services by logging in with these credentials:

Password:   waiter

[NOTE]
====
You are redirected to a login screen because -- by default -- a new _devon4j_ applications provides a basic security setup.

== Structure of the App Template
When creating _devon4j_ based apps this way, we get the following features _out-of-the-box_:

* _Maven_ project with _api_ project, _core_ project and _server_ project:
** _api_ project for the common API
** _core_ project for the app implementation
** _server_ project ready to package the app for deployment

* Data base ready environment with an _h2_ instance, including:
** Data model schema
** Mock data schema

* Database version control with _Flyway_

* _Bean Mapper_ ready

* Basic security enabled (based on _Spring Security_)

* Unit test support and model

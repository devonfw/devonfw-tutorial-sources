_JumpTheQueue_ is a small application which you will create yourself during the course of this guide. It will help you better understand the back- and frontend technologies used as part of link:https://devonfw.com/[devonfw]. At the bottom of each page you will find a link leading to the next step in the guide. Happy coding!

NOTE: An new version of this app is available at https://github.com/devonfw-forge/jump-the-queue-v2[jump-the-queue-v2]. It was redesigned from the ground up and uses a slightly different technology stack. However, no guide is available for this updated version just yet.
